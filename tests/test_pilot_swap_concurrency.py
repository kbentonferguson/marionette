"""Concurrency test for pilot-swap / rebuild interleaving.

Two threads hammer the pilot-rebind path at the same time (mirroring a
/api/pilot swap firing while a workspace-switch rebuild runs). The swap lock
must serialize the history-copy/rebind steps so the final _pilot is a single
consistent object with its carried-over _history intact and no torn state.
